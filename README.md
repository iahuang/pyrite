# pyrite

A heavily experimental compiler front-end that uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python source code into standalone executables.

## Usage

Currently, this compiler doesn't produce any binaries; however it will still process any Python files passed to it.
```
$ python pyrite.py [input-file]
```
